# Hey there, I'm Harley "Pixel"! 👋😊

I'm a full-stack magic-maker living in the heart of Eugene, Oregon. 🌲✨ When I'm not pushing pixels or tweaking code, you'll find me on hiking trails, sipping coffee, or leveling up at the gym. ☕💪

## 🚀 The Journey So Far...

My story? Unconventional! I jumped from Business Management 🎓 at Bushnell University straight into the freelance software development and digital marketing, and currently, I'm weaving automation magic at Armanino. 🤖✨

## 🛠️ I Speak Code!

Been at it for 12 years and here's the scoop:

- **Loving**: Python 🐍, Kotlin ☕
- **Using**: Django, Laravel, RoR, React, Node.js
- **Admiring**: Java, HTML/CSS 🎨

## 🌟 Current Quests & Future Boss Battles

**Now:**
- Mastering the art of RPA (it's like teaching a robot to paint! 🖌️🤖)
- Hoarding...err, *earning* more shiny certifications 🏅

**Epic Future Bosses:**
- Becoming the Gandalf of RPA (but with fewer fireworks 🎆)
- Guiding newbie devs through their first code dungeons 🧙‍♂️💻
- Leading a guild of tech heroes on legendary projects 🛡️

## 🍻 Grab a Virtual Coffee with Me?

Got an idea? A quest proposal? Or just spotted a dragon? (hey, it could happen! 🐉)
